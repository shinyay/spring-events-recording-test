# Getting Start with Spring Events
Spring application events allow us to throw and listen to specific application events that we can process as we wish.

Events are meant for exchanging information between loosely coupled components.

Event handling in the `ApplicationContext` is provided through the `ApplicationEvent` class and the `ApplicationListener` interface.
- [Standard and Custom Events](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#context-functionality-events)

There are a few simple guidelines to follow:
- the event should extend `ApplicationEvent`
- the publisher should inject an `ApplicationEventPublisher` object
- the listener should implement the `ApplicationListener` interface
